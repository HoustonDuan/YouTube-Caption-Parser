195
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:48,986
scores.

196
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,436
In later levels, you'll see

197
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,856
blocks that will change Mario's

198
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,516
direction and others that will

199
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:55,386
start and stop him with

200
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:56,786
precision timing.

201
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,006
But the goal remains simple.

202
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:01,746
Collect as many coins as you can

203
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:01,746
Collect as many coins as you can

204
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:03,926
and get to the flagpole at the

205
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:09,516
end of the level before time

206
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:09,766
runs out.

207
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,156
But what's new this time, what's

208
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:12,386
different, is that you can play

209
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,026
the game one-handed for the very

210
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:14,536
first time.

211
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,286
What that means is that you can

212
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:18,866
play while holding onto a handle

213
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,436
on the subway.

214
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,626

215

217
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:28,646
Or while eating an apple.

[ Applause ]

220
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:39,296
But in addition to the

221
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:40,696
traditional Mario gameplay,

222
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,296
we've also prepared a brand-new

223
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:43,336
way to play.

224
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,766
It's a new battle mode called

225
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,716
Toad Rally.

226
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,256
And the first thing that you do

227
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,356
in battle mode is you choose an

228
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,376
opponent from this list to try

229
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,346
to beat their high score.

230
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,256
Today, I've ask Hideki Konno to

231
00:08:59,256 --> 00:08:59,876
play for me.

232
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:01,216
So who should he compete

233
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:01,216
So who should he compete

234
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:01,576
against?

235
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,596
Looks like he picked Phil.

236
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:10,316
So we're going to try to beat

237
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:10,976
Phil's high score.

238
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,616
Now, battle mode will have you

239
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,906
competing not only against your

240
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,326
friends, but for the first time,

241
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,456
players around the world.

242
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:26,126
The victory in battle mode is

243
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:27,316
determined based on the number

244
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,276
of coins you collect and the

245
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,176
number of toads you impress,

246
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:32,866
because the toad characters

247
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,906
appear every time you do a

248
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,026
daring move.

249
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,026
There's no flagpole in the

250
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,766
battle mode, so you just keep

251
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,376
running, jumping, and collecting

252
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:42,976
coins until time runs out.

253
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,206
As you do, you may see a little

254
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,276
sticker of Mario moving through

255
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:49,566
the course.

256
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,516
In this case, that shows us what

257
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,846
Phil was doing on his run, where

258
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,536
he collected his coins, and

259
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,946
where he gathered his toad fans.

260
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,346
In the matches that you win, the

261
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,346
In the matches that you win, the

262
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:02,776
toads you gather will become

263
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:03,916
residents of your very own

264
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,986
mushroom kingdom.

265
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,656
So another new element you can

266
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,256
enjoy is expanding and

267
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,396
customizing your mushroom

268
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,706
kingdom using the coins you

269
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,166
collect in the game.

270
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,676
Oh, at the end of battle mode,

271
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:19,806
Toadette appears to tally the

272
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,586
score and show who won.

273
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:26,296
Good job, Konno-San!

275
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,286
Sorry, sorry, Phil.

276
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:43,716
We want as many people of all

277
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,756
ages to be able to enjoy playing

278
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,086
Super Mario Run.

279
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,946
And for that reason, we plan on

280
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,656
releasing the game at a set

281
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,806

282
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,636
worry about continuing to pay.

283
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:56,786

but Super Mario Run will release

289
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:09,106
in time for holidays in 2016.

it.

We've prepared a set of Super

Mario stickers for iMessage that

296
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,416
will launch day and date with

forward to Super Mario Run.

Thank you, Miyamoto-San.

We could not be more honored

306
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,496
that Nintendo chose to bring

307
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,296
Mario to iOS first.

00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,806
So that's a brief update on the

309
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:02,696
App Store.

310
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,786
Now, as we start a new school

311
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:06,936
year, let's turn our attention

312
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:08,486
to education.

313
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,576
Apple celebrated its 40th

314
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:15,296
birthday earlier this year, and

315
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,166
it's no coincidence that we've

316
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,906
been committed to education for

317
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:19,936
that entire time.

318
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,026
It's simply deep in our DNA.

319
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,396
We've always believed that

320
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,746
education is a great equalizer.

321
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,156
It's a powerful force of change

322
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:32,556
for good.

323
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:35,396
And we've always believed that

324
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,766
our products could have a

325
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,086
tremendous positive impact on

326
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,466
teachers and students.

327
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:44,686
But we are keenly aware that not

328
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:45,996
every school can have this

329
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:46,856
impact.

330
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,766
And that's why we're so deeply

331
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:50,046
committed to ConnectED.

332
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:53,346
ConnectED, as you probably know,

333
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:54,686
is a national initiative

00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,386

00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,246
these ConnectED schools, and the

385
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:44,376
year, and we are so very proud

386
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:45,886
to be a part of it.

387
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,826
But we're not stopping there.

388
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,676
We believe every student should

389
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:52,496
have the opportunity to code.

390
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:54,596
So we've created a program

391
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,466
called Everyone Can Code.

392
00:14:56,856 --> 00:14:58,176
It's Apple's approach to

393
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,426
teaching coding, and it's a

394
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,426
teaching coding, and it's a

395
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,476
cornerstone of ConnectED.

396
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:05,106
It starts with the amazing iPad

397
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,686
app Swift Playgrounds, which we

398
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,466
just announced in June.

399
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,466
And what this does is it teaches

400
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,506
Swift, our popular programming

401
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,856

00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,336
in a simple, fun, and

403
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,346
interactive way.

Survey after survey, Apple Watch

578
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,746
tops number one in customer

582
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,996

And to tell you about what is

00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:05,866

We've got a lot to talk about,

594
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:20,976
so let's get started.

595
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:24,616
In June, we previewed watchOS 3,

596
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,866
and it is packed with features.

599
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,866
already up-to-date so they're

600
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:32,836
ready when you need them.

601
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:34,726
There's a new dock so you can

602
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:36,136
quickly access your favorite

603
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:36,526
apps.

604
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:38,566
And we've made it easier than

605
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,326
ever to switch watch faces.

606
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,836
You just swipe edge to edge.

607

And we've added some great new

609
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,536
Messaging is more expressive

610
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,506
than ever with features like tap

611
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:52,996
back, where you double-tap a

612
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,796
message to send a quick reply.

613
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,866
There are fun animated stickers.

00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:10,906
You can also write custom

It's rated water resistant 50

866
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:37,766
meters, which is the industry

867
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:38,986
standard for a swim watch.

868
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:41,206
But what that means is the Watch

869
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,396
needs to withstand the water

870
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:45,196
pressure equivalent of being at

871
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,536

872
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:49,106
pretty deep.

873
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:51,296
And it's especially challenging

874
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:53,306
for a smartwatch because there

875
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,236
are so many ingress points.

876
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,666
So our engineers have been hard

877
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,086
at work developing new seals and

878
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,086
at work developing new seals and

879
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:01,476

880
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,916
to close all those entry points

881
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:05,596
except one -- the speaker.

882
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,876
You see, a speaker needs air to

883
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:10,876
produce sound.

884
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,816
And if the air can get in, so

885
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,146
can the water, and that's a

886
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:14,596
problem.

887
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:19,176
So for Series 2, we redesigned

888
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:20,206
the speaker system.

889
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,826
And at the end of your workout,

890
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:25,246
we use the speaker itself to

891
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:25,976
eject the water.

00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:48,266

to look at lactic acid levels.

920
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:34,406
And we used all this body of

921
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,876
information to create an

open water swim.

929
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:47,286
And during the workout, you'll

930
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,335
get information like lap count,

931
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,505
pace, distance, calorie burn.

932
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,416

933
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:55,676
learn about you over time and it

1038
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:10,876
I've never been before, but I

1039

hear it's beautiful.

1040

And with ViewRanger, I've

1041
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,386
selected these three hikes ahead

Apple Watch has made it

1044
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:19,636
available offline, which means I

1045
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:20,796
don't even need a cell service

1046
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,706

1049
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:26,816
And at 14 miles, it's probably a

1050
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,046
bit too intense this morning.

1051
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,406
So let's take a look at the

1052
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:30,646
four-mile trail to Glacier

1053
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:30,966

00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:33,566
quite so long.

1056
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,036
And with that elevation gain,

1057
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:36,466
it's sure to still be a great

1058
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:36,946

1059
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:38,276

At any time, I can swipe right

1066
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:51,406

reached the end of the hike.

00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,406
We think it's going to be a

1141
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:05,946
wonderful addition to the Apple

1142
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:06,896
Watch family.

1143
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:11,476
We also are offering Series 2 in

00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,846
Last year, we partnered with

1146
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:17,066
Hermes, a company known for

1147
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,296
craftsmanship and elegance and

So that's Apple Watch Series 2.

00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:49,166
It is faster.

1161
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,166
It is brighter.

1162
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:52,266
It is water resistant so you can

1163
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:52,856
swim with it.

It's got built-in GPS.

deeply about.

This is made in a responsible

way.

1174
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:11,486
We think Apple Watch is the

1175
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:13,866
ultimate device for a healthy

1176
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:14,246
life.

1177
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:17,896
And we expect it to be popular

1178
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:21,086
with everybody, but we think it

1179
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:23,366
will be especially popular with

1180
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:23,826
runners.

1181
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:26,226

special for them.

1183
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:28,556
We couldn't think of a better

1184
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:29,936
way to do that than to partner

1185
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:31,336
with a company that knows

1186
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:32,856

inspiration and innovation for

1225
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,696
every athlete, and it all began

1226
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:08,946
40 years ago with a deep

1227
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,106
relationship with runners, and

1228
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,396
that obsession continues to this

00:44:15,996 --> 00:44:18,516
Today, sports and fitness are a

1231
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:20,516
bigger part of people's lives,

1232
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,946

get out and run.

1234
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:26,746
But getting started on your own

1235
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:29,386
and staying motivated can be

1236
00:44:29,386 --> 00:44:30,036

But these devices are complex,

00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:44,566

00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:51,816
do when he just wants to get out

1247

And to do that and provide this

1717

What does that do?

1780
01:03:20,226 --> 01:03:21,756
The flicker sensor reads the

01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,356
flickering of artificial

1782
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:25,146

1783
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:26,706
it in the photos and videos you

1784
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:26,966
take.

1785
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:29,266

01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:35,016
of the camera, the image signal

01:03:43,176 --> 01:03:44,486
the iPhone 7 is twice the

What does this ISP do?

Well, I'm going to take a quick

1799
01:03:50,296 --> 01:03:51,146
walk-through of some of the

1800
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:52,626
things the ISP does every time

1801
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:53,296
we take a picture.

1802
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:54,536
It's unbelievable.

1803
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:56,166
The first thing it does is it

1804
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,936
reads the scene and uses machine

1805
01:03:57,936 --> 01:03:59,866
learning to look for objects and

1806
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:01,056
people and bodies within it.

1807
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:01,056
people and bodies within it.

1808
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:02,976
Then, it automatically sets

1809
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:06,376
exposure, sets focus using our

1810
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,476

1811
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:09,326
with white balance.

01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:10,436
In fact, for the first time,

1813
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:11,976

1814
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:13,396
cinema-standard wide color.

1815
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,316
It balances off with tone

1817
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,616
It does noise reduction.

1818
01:04:19,176 --> 01:04:20,556
And even if it needs to, it can

1819
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,916
take multiple photos and fuse

1820
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,116
them together into one to give

1821
01:04:23,116 --> 01:04:24,256
you the perfect image.

1873

And the colors, because we

capture wide color gamut images

1875
01:05:52,306 --> 01:05:53,596

01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:06,026
beautiful as it actually is in

1887
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:07,186
the photo, and you can see it on

1888
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:07,866
your iPhone.

1889
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,036
And here's an example of

1890
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:11,066
low-light photography.

1891
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:12,456
So much improved.

1892
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:13,446
It's really great.

1893
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:14,786
So customers are going to love

1894
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:16,296
taking pictures with iPhone 7.

1895
01:06:16,296 --> 01:06:17,576
They're also going to love

1896
01:06:17,576 --> 01:06:18,846
taking Live Photos.

1897
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,346
They're already fun, and they've

1898
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,506
gotten even better with iPhone

1899
01:06:22,506 --> 01:06:22,976
7.

1900
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:25,366
Now we apply video image

1901
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:27,296
stabilization when you take a

1902
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,276
Live Photo.

1903
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,576
You can edit them after you shot

1904
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:30,826
them, like crop them or apply

1905
01:06:30,956 --> 01:06:31,546
filters.

1906
01:06:32,146 --> 01:06:34,176
And developers can capture and

1907
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:35,746
edit Live Photos within their

1908
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,186
applications with iOS 10.

1909
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,536
Developers are really excited

1910
01:06:39,536 --> 01:06:41,596
that in iOS 10 you can now

1911
01:06:41,596 --> 01:06:44,226
capture RAW DNG files directly

1912
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:45,576
from the camera sensor and do

1913
01:06:45,576 --> 01:06:46,816
even more complex editing.

1914
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:48,666
And for the first time with

1915
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:50,976
iPhone 7, they can also get wide

1916
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:52,466
color in their photos that they

1917
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,356
take as well.

1918
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,246
So, this is the best camera

1919
01:06:55,246 --> 01:06:57,776
we've ever made on any iPhone.

1920
01:06:58,756 --> 01:06:59,746
We also have the best camera

1921
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,186
we've ever had on the front as

1922
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,186
we've ever had on the front as

1923
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:01,676
well.

1924
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:03,206
There's a new 7-megapixel

1925
01:07:03,206 --> 01:07:05,296
FaceTime HD camera for those

1926
01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:07,456
selfies and those FaceTime calls

1927
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:07,696
we make.

1928
01:07:07,696 --> 01:07:09,176
This is up from 5 megapixels.

1929
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:11,626
The sensor includes new pixel

1930
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:12,796
technologies that we've used on

1931
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,026
the back side, like deep trench

1932
01:07:14,026 --> 01:07:14,836
isolation.

1933
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,036
If you remember what that is, it

1934
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,816
helps us get sharper images as

1935
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,116
the pixels get closer together.

1936
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,276
It also captures wide color

1937
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:22,836
images.

1938
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:23,996
So throughout the system, we're

1939
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:24,856
applying wide color.

1940
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:26,076
And does auto image

1941
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:26,946
stabilization.

1942
01:07:27,246 --> 01:07:28,326
So this shot that you see up

1943
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:29,076
here on the screen, that was

1944
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:30,396
taken from the front-side

1945
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:32,136
camera, unedited exactly, as it

1946
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:33,896
can take a beautiful selfie.

1947
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:36,846
So this is the iPhone 7 camera.

1948
01:07:37,426 --> 01:07:39,176
New 12-megapixel camera system

1949
01:07:39,176 --> 01:07:39,886
with optical image

1950
01:07:39,886 --> 01:07:42,706
stabilization, wider F1.8

1951
01:07:42,706 --> 01:07:44,796
aperture, six elements in the

1952
01:07:44,796 --> 01:07:47,566
lens that senses 60% faster.

1953
01:07:47,806 --> 01:07:50,116
Now a quad-LED True Tone flash.

1954
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:53,676
Our incredibly fast ISP and wide

1955
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:54,536
color capture.

1956
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:57,236
It is the best camera ever in an

1957
01:07:57,236 --> 01:07:57,906
iPhone.

1958
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:05,546
[ Applause ]

1959
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:05,546
[ Applause ]

1960
01:08:06,046 --> 01:08:08,036
If you can't tell, I love

1961
01:08:08,036 --> 01:08:08,636
cameras.

1962
01:08:08,746 --> 01:08:10,186
I love them.

1963
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,466
And this has got me so excited.

1964
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,306
Because if that is the best

1965
01:08:13,346 --> 01:08:14,666
camera we've ever made in

1966
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:17,416
iPhone, what is left for iPhone

1967
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:17,826
7?

1968
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:21,986
And this is what we're doing on

1969
01:08:21,986 --> 01:08:23,566
iPhone 7 Plus.

1970
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:26,526
It's plus a second camera.

1971
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,185
There's now two 12-megapixel

1972
01:08:29,216 --> 01:08:31,636
cameras built in to the iPhone 7

1973
01:08:31,636 --> 01:08:32,136
Plus.

1974
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:35,116
One has the wide-angle

1975
01:08:35,116 --> 01:08:36,946
28-millimeter lens, the same as

1976
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,786
the iPhone 7.

1977
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:40,145
The other is a telephoto

1978
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:41,566
56-millimeter lens.

1979
01:08:41,946 --> 01:08:43,276
Well, why have two complete

1980
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:44,916
cameras with two lenses?

1981
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:46,736
Well, to explain it, let me show

1982
01:08:46,736 --> 01:08:47,395
you a traditional

1983
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:48,926
point-and-shoot or DSLR and how

1984
01:08:48,926 --> 01:08:49,746
the lens can work.

1985
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:51,305
As you know, when we have many

1986
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:52,526
of these cameras in our lives,

1987
01:08:52,906 --> 01:08:55,216
you can change the focal length

1988
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:57,276
of your lens to zoom in.

1989
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,576
That's how we get a zoom

1990
01:08:58,576 --> 01:08:58,956
feature.

1991
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,236
And that works great when you

1992
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,236
And that works great when you

1993
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,946
have a large camera with a big

1994
01:09:01,946 --> 01:09:02,506
lens on it.

1995
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:03,546
You can move in and out.

1996
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,895
That isn't so great on the lens

1997
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:06,816
you want to put in something

1998
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:08,356
that goes in your pocket or your

1999
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:08,866
purse.

2000
01:09:09,935 --> 01:09:12,716
So we know with two cameras and

2001
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:14,216
two different lenses, we can

2002
01:09:14,305 --> 01:09:16,725
create a zoom feature built in

2003
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:17,666
to the iPhone.

2004
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:19,906
It takes an incredible amount of

2005
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,296
hardware and software to do it

2006
01:09:21,296 --> 01:09:23,076
in a way that we can all enjoy,

2007
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,336
and the team has done something

2008
01:09:24,336 --> 01:09:24,916
remarkable.

2009
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:26,336
So how does it work?

2010
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,185
The same as before.

2011
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:29,935
You go into the Camera app to

2012
01:09:29,935 --> 01:09:30,586
take a picture.

2013
01:09:31,026 --> 01:09:32,616
But now there's a new button

2014
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:33,725
right there on the screen -- let

2015
01:09:33,725 --> 01:09:34,796
me blow it up a teeny bit.

2016
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,046
It says 1x.

2017
01:09:36,236 --> 01:09:37,196
It's right above the shutter.

2018
01:09:37,196 --> 01:09:38,546
And when you go to take a

2019
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:40,106
picture, it's using the

2020
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:41,336
wide-angle lens and taking a

2021
01:09:41,336 --> 01:09:42,645
picture just as always.

2022
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:44,236
But now with this button, you

2023
01:09:44,236 --> 01:09:45,486
can do one of two things.

2024
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:48,166
First, you can just tap it and

2025
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:49,395
it jumps to 2x.

2026
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:50,996
Now you're taking a picture with

2027
01:09:50,996 --> 01:09:52,136
a telephoto lens.

2028
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:53,305
You're getting the same

2029
01:09:53,486 --> 01:09:55,236
high-quality 12-megapixel

2030
01:09:55,646 --> 01:09:57,386
picture with a beautiful optical

2031
01:09:57,386 --> 01:09:59,076
lens, no software needed.

2032
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:01,336
The second thing you can do is

2033
01:10:01,336 --> 01:10:02,526
you can put your finger on it

2034
01:10:02,526 --> 01:10:04,686
and drag across it, and you can

2035
01:10:04,686 --> 01:10:06,536
zoom from 1x to 5x.

2036
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,126
As you go beyond 2x, you're

2037
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:09,346
doing software zoom.

2038
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:11,206
But now, since it's starting

2039
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:12,746
with that telephoto lens, the

2040
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:14,276
quality of that image is four

2041
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,066
times better than before with

2042
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:17,186
software zoom.

2043
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,626
In fact, it's so much better we

2044
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:20,056
decided to push it even further

2045
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,676
all the way up to 10x.

2046
01:10:22,396 --> 01:10:22,936
So now --

2047
01:10:23,516 --> 01:10:32,426
[ Applause ]

2048
01:10:32,926 --> 01:10:34,266
So, as you see here, now with

2049
01:10:34,436 --> 01:10:36,056
iPhone 7 Plus, you can go from

2050
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:37,576
1x to 10x.

2051
01:10:37,836 --> 01:10:39,806
Optical zoom at 2x, and great

2052
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:41,196
software zoom after that.

2053
01:10:42,256 --> 01:10:43,396
Here's an example of two photos

2054
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:44,236
side by side.

2055
01:10:44,236 --> 01:10:46,316
The one on the left taken at 1x,

2056
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:48,076
the one on the right at 2x, both

2057
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:49,846
with beautiful optical lens

2058
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:50,356
quality.

2059
01:10:51,006 --> 01:10:52,186
Both are great examples of

2060
01:10:52,186 --> 01:10:53,866
taking low-light pictures now

2061
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:55,496
with incredible new cameras in

2062
01:10:55,546 --> 01:10:56,516
iPhone 7 Plus.

2063
01:10:57,196 --> 01:10:58,556
So that's the camera on iPhone 7

2064
01:10:58,556 --> 01:11:00,926
Plus, joining iPhone 7, with its

2065
01:10:58,556 --> 01:11:00,926
Plus, joining iPhone 7, with its

2066
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:02,016
great new zoom feature.

2067
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:04,806
There's one other use of this

2068
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,596
camera that we challenged our

2069
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,276
engineering team to do as an

2070
01:11:09,276 --> 01:11:10,436
extra credit project.

2071
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:12,616
It really was.

2072
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:13,956
It's something that is

2073
01:11:13,956 --> 01:11:15,676
incredibly challenging and takes

2074
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:17,926
a lot of amazing invention, but

2075
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:19,156
what they've been doing is

2076
01:11:19,156 --> 01:11:19,886
astounding.

2077
01:11:20,356 --> 01:11:21,886
And it's something that's a big

2078
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:24,296
breakthrough in photography, and

2079
01:11:24,296 --> 01:11:25,756
we want to give you a sneak peek

2080
01:11:25,976 --> 01:11:26,686
of this feature.

2081
01:11:27,456 --> 01:11:28,806
Now, to explain it, I'm going to

2082
01:11:28,806 --> 01:11:29,616
bring up a picture.

2083
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,736
This is a picture that was taken

2084
01:11:31,736 --> 01:11:32,856
with a very high-end camera.

2085
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:34,186
And so it will help us

2086
01:11:34,186 --> 01:11:36,276
illustrate the feature we're

2087
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:37,146
trying to achieve.

2088
01:11:38,036 --> 01:11:38,916
Let me bring up a picture.

2089
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:40,896
You see in this beautiful

2090
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:42,496
portrait the gentleman in the

2091
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:44,996
front is pin sharp in focus, and

2092
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:47,126
that background has a beautiful

2093
01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:47,676
blur.

2094
01:11:48,316 --> 01:11:49,686
This is called shallow depth of

2095
01:11:49,776 --> 01:11:50,166
field.

2096
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:51,806
This is a technique that's

2097
01:11:51,876 --> 01:11:53,686
really useful for things like

2098
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:54,516
portraiture.

2099
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:56,656
And it's something that is

2100
01:11:56,656 --> 01:11:58,096
illustrative of a great camera

2101
01:11:58,096 --> 01:11:59,646
that has often a very big

2102
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:00,726
sensor, like a full-frame

2103
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:00,726
sensor, like a full-frame

2104
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:03,746
sensor, or a really big, fast

2105
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:04,416
lens.

2106
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:05,866
And the quality of that

2107
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:06,976
background blur, that's what's

2108
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:07,786
called bokeh.

2109
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,206
And the higher the quality of

2110
01:12:09,206 --> 01:12:10,646
the bokeh, usually the more

2111
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:11,936
advanced and higher quality the

2112
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:13,066
camera and lens system.

2113
01:12:13,736 --> 01:12:15,516
The ending result is it feels

2114
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:16,976
almost 3D, like the person is

2115
01:12:16,976 --> 01:12:18,086
popping off the screen.

2116
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:20,006
It is a beautiful photo.

2117
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:21,166
So our goal is to try to do

2118
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,546
something like this using the

2119
01:12:23,546 --> 01:12:25,046
two cameras in the iPhone 7

2120
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:25,516
Plus.

2121
01:12:26,036 --> 01:12:27,146
What the engineering team has

2122
01:12:27,146 --> 01:12:28,016
been doing, hardware and

2123
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:29,336
software working together, is

2124
01:12:29,406 --> 01:12:30,276
truly remarkable.

2125
01:12:31,376 --> 01:12:32,876
What they're able to do is, when

2126
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:34,836
we take a picture, is to use the

2127
01:12:34,836 --> 01:12:37,476
ISP to scan the scene and use

2128
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:39,066
machine learning to recognize

2129
01:12:39,066 --> 01:12:40,686
people and faces, and then

2130
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:43,696
create a depth map of that image

2131
01:12:43,886 --> 01:12:44,896
from the two cameras and the

2132
01:12:44,896 --> 01:12:45,466
software.

2133
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:47,756
Keep the people in the front

2134
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:49,126
sharp in focus and apply a

2135
01:12:49,126 --> 01:12:49,956
beautiful blur to the

2136
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:50,596
background.

2137
01:12:50,986 --> 01:12:53,016
This is a huge breakthrough in

2138
01:12:53,016 --> 01:12:54,946
what can be done on a smartphone

2139
01:12:54,946 --> 01:12:55,676
in photography.

2140
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:57,416
So how do you do it?

2141
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,706
Well, it couldn't be easier.

2142
01:12:59,206 --> 01:13:01,126
Again, we go to the Camera app,

2143
01:12:59,206 --> 01:13:01,126
Again, we go to the Camera app,

2144
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,266
you go to take a picture.

2145
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:03,926
Where you normally select the

2146
01:13:03,986 --> 01:13:05,366
style of the picture, so

2147
01:13:05,366 --> 01:13:07,356
panorama or square, there's a

2148
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:09,126
new style that says "portrait."

2149
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:10,896
You select portrait, it

2150
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:12,166
automatically jumps to using the

2151
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,276
telephoto lens because that

2152
01:13:13,276 --> 01:13:15,336
56-millimeter lens is great for

2153
01:13:15,406 --> 01:13:18,306
portrait lens, and automatically

2154
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:19,806
you see the depth effect.

2155
01:13:19,806 --> 01:13:21,826
Now, what's remarkable is that

2156
01:13:21,826 --> 01:13:23,416
before you take a picture, as

2157
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:24,476
you're looking at your iPhone

2158
01:13:24,476 --> 01:13:26,426
screen, you are seeing that blur

2159
01:13:26,426 --> 01:13:27,006
in the background.

2160
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:28,536
It is being generated in real

2161
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:29,566
time as you're looking at your

2162
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:30,006
screen.

2163
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:32,366
Even high-end DSLRs can't do

2164
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:34,176
real-time deep depth preview in

2165
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:34,896
their screens.

2166
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:36,506
This is an incredible

2167
01:13:36,506 --> 01:13:36,976
breakthrough.

2168
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:38,266
So now I'm going to show you the

2169
01:13:38,406 --> 01:13:40,626
first picture we've ever shown

2170
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:43,236
the world of a depth-of-field

2171
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:45,916
photo taken from an iPhone 7

2172
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,176
Plus with this new feature.

2173
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,276
Before I do, I have to come

2174
01:13:49,276 --> 01:13:50,186
clean on something because I

2175
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:52,356
wasn't entirely honest before.

2176
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,306
The picture I showed you before,

2177
01:13:54,766 --> 01:13:56,636
this was taken on an iPhone 7

2178
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:56,886
Plus.

2179
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:09,946
[ Applause ]

2180
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:09,946
[ Applause ]

2181
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,406
It is stunning.

2182
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:12,826
Again, we've given some

2183
01:14:12,826 --> 01:14:14,076
photographers early access to

2184
01:14:14,136 --> 01:14:16,096
the 7 Plus and the software

2185
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:17,226
feature, and they've been blown

2186
01:14:17,226 --> 01:14:19,066
away by how it performs.

2187
01:14:19,186 --> 01:14:20,996
Let me give you one quote from a

2188
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:21,526
photographer.

2189
01:14:21,776 --> 01:14:23,606
Jason Nocito said, "I loved the

2190
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:24,836
depth of field capabilities and

2191
01:14:25,036 --> 01:14:26,076
the ability to shoot fast

2192
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:27,766
without losing sharpness.

2193
01:14:27,766 --> 01:14:29,456
This iPhone proves you don't

2194
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:31,236
need a five-figure rig to get a

2195
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:32,276
great photographer.

2196
01:14:33,016 --> 01:14:34,666
This camera is going to change

2197
01:14:34,776 --> 01:14:35,226
the game."

2198
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,856
Now, we are not saying to throw

2199
01:14:38,856 --> 01:14:40,206
out your DSLRs and that iPhone

2200
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,676
replaces all the DSLRs.

2201
01:14:42,196 --> 01:14:43,896
What we are saying is this is

2202
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,606
the best camera we have ever

2203
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,836
made in an iPhone.

2204
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,556
This is the best camera ever

2205
01:14:48,556 --> 01:14:50,186
made in any smartphone.

2206
01:14:50,606 --> 01:14:51,636
For many of the customers who

2207
01:14:51,636 --> 01:14:52,906
have it, it'll probably be the

2208
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:54,086
best camera they've ever owned

2209
01:14:54,086 --> 01:14:54,536
to date.

2210
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,466
But more importantly, it allows

2211
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:57,766
them to create beautiful

2212
01:14:57,766 --> 01:14:59,376
pictures with incredible

2213
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:00,396
creative tools.

2214
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:00,396
creative tools.

2215
01:15:01,036 --> 01:15:01,826
So let me show you two more

2216
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:03,816
examples taken from the iPhone 7

2217
01:15:03,816 --> 01:15:05,546
Plus with its depth of field.

2218
01:15:06,226 --> 01:15:07,076
Here's another photo.

2219
01:15:07,956 --> 01:15:11,246
That's absolutely beautiful.

2220
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:15,246
One more. It is an incredible

2221
01:15:15,246 --> 01:15:15,706
tool.

2222
01:15:15,706 --> 01:15:16,976
It's not for every style of

2223
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:17,546
picture you're going to take.

2224
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,606
But for the ones you want to use

2225
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:20,106
it on, it's a pretty big

2226
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:20,636
breakthrough.

2227
01:15:21,036 --> 01:15:22,926
So, how will iPhone 7 Plus users

2228
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:24,446
get this great feature?

2229
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:25,476
Well, simple.

2230
01:15:25,476 --> 01:15:27,606
It will be a free software

2231
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,916
update later this year to all

2232
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,236
iPhone 7 Plus users.

2233
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:32,976
So that's the camera.

2234
01:15:33,516 --> 01:15:39,356
[ Applause ]

2235
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:41,616
Next, let's talk about the

2236
01:15:41,616 --> 01:15:43,336
Retina HD display.

2237
01:15:43,336 --> 01:15:45,126
The Retina HD display is the

2238
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:47,276
best display on any smartphone.

2239
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:50,946
And in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, they

2240
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:51,856
get even better.

2241
01:15:51,856 --> 01:15:55,076
They're now 25% brighter than

2242
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:56,506
the 6s and 6s Plus.

2243
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,266
For the first time, they display

2244
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,856
wide color gamut, that's cinema

2245
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,856
wide color gamut, that's cinema

2246
01:16:00,906 --> 01:16:01,936
P3 standard colors.

2247
01:16:02,986 --> 01:16:04,446
And we do end-to-end color

2248
01:16:04,446 --> 01:16:05,786
management from the manufacturer

2249
01:16:05,786 --> 01:16:07,366
in the factory to the photos you

2250
01:16:07,366 --> 01:16:08,386
take with the camera to what you

2251
01:16:08,386 --> 01:16:10,486
see on the display are all color

2252
01:16:10,486 --> 01:16:11,746
managed in a beautiful way.

2253
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:13,776
And don't forget we integrate

2254
01:16:13,776 --> 01:16:15,166
within the Retina HD display our

2255
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,156
3D Touch layer.

2256
01:16:16,536 --> 01:16:17,826
This is an important element of

2257
01:16:17,826 --> 01:16:18,756
the user interface.

2258
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,316
And in iOS 10, the team has

2259
01:16:20,316 --> 01:16:21,746
taken great use of this, so

2260
01:16:21,746 --> 01:16:22,726
we're going to use it more

2261
01:16:22,726 --> 01:16:23,826
throughout our day in very

2262
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:24,856
powerful ways.

2263
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:26,756
So we wanted to show you one

2264
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:28,586
example of an app taking

2265
01:16:28,586 --> 01:16:29,746
advantage of all of this, taking

2266
01:16:29,746 --> 01:16:31,036
advantage of the Retina HD

2267
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,906
display and its wide color, of

2268
01:16:32,906 --> 01:16:34,686
the camera's built in iPhone 7,

2269
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:36,456
and of course, 3D Touch.

2270
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:38,226
We want to show you a photo app.

2271
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,146
And who knows photos and apps

2272
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:41,636
better than Instagram?

2273
01:16:41,986 --> 01:16:43,656
So I'm very excited to bring up

2274
01:16:43,656 --> 01:16:45,466
Ian Spalter, Head of Design at

2275
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:46,066

[ Applause ]

2278
01:16:50,976 --> 01:16:51,676
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody.

2279
01:16:52,966 --> 01:16:54,006
I'm excited to share with you

2280
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:55,056
what we've built to take

2281
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:56,506
advantage of this new iPhone's

2282
01:16:56,506 --> 01:16:58,556
gorgeous wide color screen and

2283
01:16:58,556 --> 01:16:59,356
dual lens camera.

2284
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:01,536
About a month ago, we launched a

2285
01:17:01,536 --> 01:17:02,606
new product called Instagram

2286
01:17:02,606 --> 01:17:04,236
Stories, and we've seen people

2287
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:05,636
sharing moments ranging from

2288
01:17:05,636 --> 01:17:07,536
their everyday lives to behind

2289
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:08,326
the scenes at the Olympics.

2290
01:17:09,196 --> 01:17:10,266
So let's jump into the stories

2291
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:11,796
camera using the new 3D Touch

2292
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:12,486
quick action.

2293
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:15,446
Now the first thing we love

2294
01:17:15,446 --> 01:17:16,776
about this new iPhone is this

2295
01:17:16,776 --> 01:17:18,236
beautiful zoom that goes

2296
01:17:18,236 --> 01:17:19,926
optically to 2x without losing

2297
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:20,866
any resolution.

2298
01:17:21,646 --> 01:17:23,436
We built a new zoom UI with

2299
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:24,846
haptic feedback so you can

2300
01:17:24,846 --> 01:17:26,266
really feel when you push into

2301
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,216
that digital zoom.

2302
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,726
But now let's take a photo.

2303
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:37,016
[ Laughter ]

[ Applause ]

2305
01:17:39,596 --> 01:17:40,016
Thank you.

2306
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:43,806
Check out how bright and vivid

2307
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:45,326
the colors are thanks to the new

2308
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:47,346
wide color capture of the new

2309
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:47,776
camera.

2310
01:17:49,006 --> 01:17:51,166
So, photos don't always capture

2311
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:51,866
the moment fully.

2312
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:54,426
So with a tap of a button, we

2313
01:17:54,426 --> 01:17:55,836
used a live photos API to

2314
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:57,196
quickly create a boomerang to

2315
01:17:57,396 --> 01:17:58,646
bring the moment to life.

2316
01:17:59,116 --> 01:17:59,876
You can also import your

2317
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:00,956
existing live photos to do the

2318
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:00,956
existing live photos to do the

2319
01:18:00,996 --> 01:18:01,476
same thing.

2320
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:03,936
Now this is awesome, but we

2321
01:18:03,936 --> 01:18:05,306
wanted to go a step further and

2322
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,346
really take full advantage of

2323
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:08,256
this wide color gamut screen.

2324
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:09,966
So we built a new filter to do

2325
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:12,136
just that by pushing into parts

2326
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:13,786
of the color spectrum that just

2327
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:15,296
weren't possible with sRGB.

2328
01:18:16,436 --> 01:18:18,306
So with this new filter, you can

2329
01:18:18,306 --> 01:18:19,666
see colors pop in a way that

2330
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:20,756
you've never seen before.

2331
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:23,206
In fact, we've updated all of

2332
01:18:23,206 --> 01:18:24,266
our photo filters to take

2333
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,876
advantage of wide gamut.

2334
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:27,216
So no matter what your favorite

2335
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:28,506
filter is, you're going to be

2336
01:18:28,506 --> 01:18:29,516

2337
01:18:29,516 --> 01:18:31,156

2338
01:18:31,156 --> 01:18:31,836
vibrant color.

2340
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:40,006
And finally, once you're happy

2341
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,056
with what you've created, you

2342
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,116
can share the moment with

2343
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:43,616
friends with a single tap.

2344
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:45,806
And then if one of them replies,

2345
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:47,796
our iOS 10-rich notifications

01:18:47,796 --> 01:18:48,816

will be launching later this

2350
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:54,356

01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:10,256
&gt;&gt; Six, let's talk about audio.

2357
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:12,276
First, we use the built-in

2358
01:19:12,276 --> 01:19:14,456
speaker in our iPhone all the

2359
01:19:14,456 --> 01:19:14,766
time.

2360
01:19:14,766 --> 01:19:16,206
We use it to listen to music,

2361
01:19:16,306 --> 01:19:17,186
especially with friends.

2362
01:19:17,906 --> 01:19:19,416
We listen to it to make FaceTime

2363
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:21,686
calls, watch TV shows, watch

2364
01:19:21,686 --> 01:19:23,966
movies, do speakerphone calls.

2365
01:19:23,966 --> 01:19:25,666
It is critical to our experience

2366
01:19:25,706 --> 01:19:26,476
with our phones.

2367
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:29,156
And the speakers we have built

2368
01:19:29,156 --> 01:19:32,116
in to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are a

2369
01:19:32,116 --> 01:19:33,526
huge jump forward in audio

2370
01:19:33,526 --> 01:19:33,986
quality.

2371
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,746
For the first time, there's

2372
01:19:35,746 --> 01:19:36,846
stereo speakers.

[ Applause ]

2374
01:19:42,296 --> 01:19:43,636
One is at the bottom, the other

2375
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:44,236
is at the top.

2376
01:19:44,236 --> 01:19:45,536
They sound great in portrait and

2377
01:19:45,536 --> 01:19:47,156
amazing in landscape.

2378
01:19:47,686 --> 01:19:49,096
They also put out twice the

2379
01:19:49,096 --> 01:19:51,226
volume of the speakers in the

2380
01:19:51,226 --> 01:19:53,196
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and they

2381
01:19:53,316 --> 01:19:54,156
sound better because they have

2382
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,796
an increased dynamic range.

2383
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:57,326
So you have to take a listen to

2384
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:58,496
these incredible speakers.

2385
01:19:58,846 --> 01:20:00,246

Apple EarPods are the most

01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:09,656
popular headphones in the world.

2390
01:20:10,266 --> 01:20:12,876
And with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,

2391
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:14,126
we're moving to connecting them

2392
01:20:14,466 --> 01:20:14,976
over Lightning.

2393
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,986
Well, why over Lightning?

2394
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:19,706
Well, first you may not remember

2395
01:20:19,926 --> 01:20:21,326
-- I certainly do -- but from

2396
01:20:21,326 --> 01:20:23,646
the start, we designed Lightning

2397
01:20:23,646 --> 01:20:25,316
to be a great digital audio

2398
01:20:25,316 --> 01:20:25,866
connector.

2399
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,246
Among all the other things it

2400
01:20:27,246 --> 01:20:28,436
does, it provides a digital

2401
01:20:28,436 --> 01:20:30,376
audio stream, it provides power

2402
01:20:30,376 --> 01:20:31,946
to your headphones or speakers,

2403
01:20:31,946 --> 01:20:33,836
it provides content music

2404
01:20:33,836 --> 01:20:36,026
control right within its digital

2405
01:20:36,026 --> 01:20:36,496
connection.

2406
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:38,936
And this may surprise you, but

2407
01:20:38,936 --> 01:20:41,186
there are now in the world over

2408
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:43,856
900 million Lightning-enabled

2409
01:20:43,856 --> 01:20:44,386
devices.

2410
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,626
It is perhaps the largest

2411
01:20:46,786 --> 01:20:48,446
digital audio connection in the

2412
01:20:48,446 --> 01:20:49,026
world.

2413
01:20:49,926 --> 01:20:50,886
And there are speakers and

2414
01:20:50,886 --> 01:20:52,426
headphones designed to take

2415
01:20:52,426 --> 01:20:53,326
advantage of it, and they do

2416
01:20:53,326 --> 01:20:54,026
great things.

2417
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:55,106
Here's one example.

2418
01:20:55,286 --> 01:20:56,616
This is from JBL.

2419
01:20:56,616 --> 01:20:58,236
This is the Reflect Aware

2420
01:20:58,536 --> 01:20:59,526
workout headphone.

2421
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:00,826
It's lightweight, it's

2422
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:00,826
It's lightweight, it's

2423
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:02,686
affordable, provides active

2424
01:21:02,686 --> 01:21:03,826
noise cancellation.

2425
01:21:03,996 --> 01:21:05,106
In fact, with an app on your

2426
01:21:05,106 --> 01:21:06,316
iPhone, it's adaptive and you

2427
01:21:06,316 --> 01:21:07,596
can adjust how much exterior

2428
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:09,086
noise you want to let in or not.

2429
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:10,756
And it does it all without

2430
01:21:10,756 --> 01:21:12,096
batteries or charging because it

2431
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:13,536
works directly over that

2432
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:14,566
Lightning connector.

2433
01:21:14,886 --> 01:21:16,586
Simply not possible on just an

2434
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:17,766
analog port.

2435
01:21:18,926 --> 01:21:20,406
So we're taking the headphones

2436
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:22,576
in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to

2437
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:24,226
Lightning, and we're including

2438
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:26,086
them in a box with each device.

2439
01:21:27,286 --> 01:21:28,636
Now, we know there are people in

2440
01:21:28,636 --> 01:21:29,696

The courage to move on, do

something new that betters all

tremendous courage.

2468
01:22:26,086 --> 01:22:28,696
So first, we've shown that we

And it is a great connector for

01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:38,786
doing that and has a very large

But second -- and this is really

2478
01:22:42,736 --> 01:22:45,636
important -- our smartphones are

2479

2496
01:23:09,686 --> 01:23:11,456

01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,426
your devices.

2629
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:49,536
It's that easy.

2630
01:27:50,036 --> 01:27:52,176
They're an incredible audio

2631
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:52,896
experience.

2632
01:27:52,896 --> 01:27:54,296
You can listen to beautiful

2633
01:27:54,296 --> 01:27:56,626
music in stereo, or if you want

2634
01:27:56,626 --> 01:27:58,836
to use one just to talk to Siri

2635
01:27:58,986 --> 01:28:00,206
or make a phone call, it

2636
01:27:58,986 --> 01:28:00,206
or make a phone call, it

2637
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:02,006
automatically routes the audio

2638
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,336
across whatever you choose to

2639
01:28:03,336 --> 01:28:03,866
do.

2640
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:04,636
There's no buttons.

2641
01:28:04,636 --> 01:28:05,546
There's no switching.

2642
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:06,956
There's no pairing.

2643
01:28:06,956 --> 01:28:07,926
There's no unpairing.

2644
01:28:08,676 --> 01:28:12,656
Those things are of the past.

2645
01:28:12,826 --> 01:28:13,916
And it all started with a

2646
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:17,186
brand-new chip, the W1 chip,

2647
01:28:17,186 --> 01:28:18,686
Apple's first wireless chip.

2648
01:28:18,766 --> 01:28:20,436
And there's so much technology

2649
01:28:20,436 --> 01:28:21,936
packed into each AirPod.

2650
01:28:22,566 --> 01:28:23,786
There's the chip, there's dual

2651
01:28:23,786 --> 01:28:25,736
accelerometers, optical sensors,

2652
01:28:25,736 --> 01:28:27,186
beamforming microphones,

2653
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:28,196
antennas, batteries.

2654
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,406
It is a technical tour de force

2655
01:28:30,456 --> 01:28:32,716
in this minute, little AirPod.

2656
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:35,646
It delivers great battery life

2657
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:36,846
-- 5 hours each.

2658
01:28:37,086 --> 01:28:38,306
And there's a battery and

2659
01:28:38,306 --> 01:28:40,546
charger built into its case so

2660
01:28:40,546 --> 01:28:41,746
you can recharge directly from

2661
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:42,746
the battery in the case for up

2662
01:28:42,746 --> 01:28:44,456
to 24 hours of listening and

2663
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:45,956
then plug in Lightning once you

2664
01:28:45,956 --> 01:28:47,466
want to charge the case and the

2665
01:28:47,466 --> 01:28:48,986
AirPods together at once.

2666
01:28:49,556 --> 01:28:50,706
And they're so small you'll want

2667
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:51,806
to carry them around with you

2668
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:52,456
everywhere.

2669
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:54,086
Here they are alongside our

2670
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:55,606
wired EarPods.

2671
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:57,866
They really are small and

2672
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:58,336
comfortable.

2673
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:01,026
So that is the breakthrough

2674
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:01,026
So that is the breakthrough

2675
01:29:01,456 --> 01:29:03,876
AirPods based on our W1 chip.

2676
01:29:04,466 --> 01:29:06,896
And, at the same time, Beats is

2677
01:29:06,896 --> 01:29:08,746
also coming out with a new line

2678
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:10,956
of headphones all also taking

2679
01:29:10,956 --> 01:29:12,466
advantage of this W1 chip and

2680
01:29:12,466 --> 01:29:13,636
doing the same great work with

2681
01:29:13,636 --> 01:29:14,596
our software to make the

2682
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:16,426
experience easy to use.

2683
01:29:16,866 --> 01:29:19,216
So today, Beats is launching the

2684
01:29:19,216 --> 01:29:21,446
new Beats Solo 3 Wireless,

2685
01:29:21,716 --> 01:29:23,476
incredible audio quality, up to

2686
01:29:23,656 --> 01:29:26,846
40 hours of listening time using

2687
01:29:26,956 --> 01:29:27,816
that W1 chip.

2688
01:29:27,816 --> 01:29:30,866
And for workouts, Powerbeats 3

2689
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,616
Wireless, the best active

2690
01:29:32,616 --> 01:29:34,926
headphones, and now they use our

2691
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:35,896
W1 chip as well for incredible

2692
01:29:35,896 --> 01:29:37,366
sound and battery life.

2693
01:29:37,366 --> 01:29:39,036
And an entirely new line,

2694
01:29:39,426 --> 01:29:39,866
BeatsX.

2695
01:29:40,536 --> 01:29:41,966
This is affordable, light,

2696
01:29:41,966 --> 01:29:44,026
comfortable headphone for all

2697
01:29:44,026 --> 01:29:44,596
throughout your day.

2698
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:47,566
Those three plus the new AirPods

2699
01:29:47,566 --> 01:29:49,566
means now a brand-new wireless

2700
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:51,486
experience for everyone

2701
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,706
regardless of what kind of style

2702
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:53,756
of headphone you want to wear.

2703
01:29:54,696 --> 01:29:55,976
And that's wireless.

2704
01:29:56,516 --> 01:30:04,256
[ Applause ]

2705
01:29:56,516 --> 01:30:04,256
[ Applause ]

2706
01:30:04,756 --> 01:30:05,936
Let's talk about Apple Pay.

2707
01:30:05,936 --> 01:30:08,096
Our customers love using Apple

2708
01:30:08,096 --> 01:30:08,246
Pay.

2709
01:30:08,246 --> 01:30:10,506
And this is amazing.

2710
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:11,856
In the US, merchants tell us

2711
01:30:11,856 --> 01:30:14,496
that over 90% of wireless

2712
01:30:14,496 --> 01:30:16,356
transactions on contactless

2713
01:30:16,356 --> 01:30:17,946
payment are now made with Apple

2714
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:18,266
Pay.

2715
01:30:18,596 --> 01:30:19,806
It is a huge hit.

2716
01:30:19,806 --> 01:30:22,266
And with the advances in iOS 10,

2717
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:24,096
it gets even easier to keep all

2718
01:30:24,096 --> 01:30:25,836
your credit cards, your loyalty

2719
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:27,666
cards safely in your Apple

2720
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:29,336
Wallet on your iPhone.

2721
01:30:30,496 --> 01:30:31,636
We're trying to bring it around

2722
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:33,276
the world as quickly as we can,

2723
01:30:33,276 --> 01:30:34,536
and the team is launching new

2724
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:35,426
countries this is fall.

2725
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:36,936
I want to talk about one of them

2726
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:38,226
-- Japan.

2727
01:30:38,226 --> 01:30:40,306
Yeah, we got a hoo right out

2728
01:30:40,306 --> 01:30:40,466
here.

2729
01:30:40,896 --> 01:30:43,026
Japan. You may know that, in

2730
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:44,286
Japan, they use a different

2731
01:30:44,286 --> 01:30:46,796
version of NFC called FeliCa.

2732
01:30:47,236 --> 01:30:50,066
So for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus

2733
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:51,596
that we're bringing to Japan,

2734
01:30:51,836 --> 01:30:53,166
we're including FeliCa

2735
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,476
technology, as well as Apple

2736
01:30:55,476 --> 01:30:57,546
Watch Series 2 will also include

2737
01:30:57,616 --> 01:30:58,806
FeliCa technology.

2738
01:30:59,426 --> 01:31:01,786
And with that in place, then we

2739
01:30:59,426 --> 01:31:01,786
And with that in place, then we

2740
01:31:01,786 --> 01:31:04,266
can roll out Apple Pay in Japan,

2741
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:05,796
and we're going to do that in

2742
01:31:05,796 --> 01:31:06,366
October.

2743
01:31:06,906 --> 01:31:08,746
At the same time, the Apple Maps

2744
01:31:09,086 --> 01:31:10,406
team is going to roll out

2745
01:31:10,406 --> 01:31:12,166
Transit in Japan because that's

2746
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,306
the perfect fit.

2747
01:31:13,306 --> 01:31:15,376
Transit in Maps, the ability to

2748
01:31:15,446 --> 01:31:16,246
figure out what it's going to

2749
01:31:16,246 --> 01:31:17,726
cost to get on your route and to

2750
01:31:17,726 --> 01:31:19,096
be able to pay it automatically

2751
01:31:19,376 --> 01:31:21,356
with your Apple Watch or your

2752
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:21,696
iPhone.

2753
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:23,446
So that's Apple Pay.

2754
01:31:23,976 --> 01:31:25,746
And that takes us to number 10.

2755
01:31:26,516 --> 01:31:30,936
[ Applause ]

2756
01:31:31,436 --> 01:31:33,486
And honestly, I'm almost

2757
01:31:33,486 --> 01:31:34,526
embarrassed that we have this

2758
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:35,666
one till last because this

2759
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,716
easily could have been the

2760
01:31:36,826 --> 01:31:37,236
first.

2761
01:31:38,106 --> 01:31:39,916
It is performance.

2762
01:31:40,816 --> 01:31:41,946
And if you're paying attention,

2763
01:31:41,946 --> 01:31:43,596
you know Apple's chip team is

2764
01:31:43,676 --> 01:31:45,366
killing it in performance.

2765
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:46,736
What they're doing year after

2766
01:31:46,796 --> 01:31:48,526
year is remarkable.

2767
01:31:48,766 --> 01:31:50,686
Every year, the iPhone is the

2768
01:31:50,686 --> 01:31:52,176
fastest smartphone in the

2769
01:31:52,176 --> 01:31:53,746
market, and that's continued

2770
01:31:53,746 --> 01:31:54,676
even to this day.

2771
01:31:54,986 --> 01:31:57,406
But what's happening today with

2772
01:31:57,406 --> 01:31:59,636
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus blows that

2773
01:31:59,636 --> 01:32:01,196
all away because we have a new

2774
01:31:59,636 --> 01:32:01,196
all away because we have a new

2775
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:03,466
generation chip in the iPhone 7,

2776
01:32:03,736 --> 01:32:06,976
and it's called A10 Fusion.

2777
01:32:07,516 --> 01:32:13,506
[ Applause ]

2778
01:32:14,006 --> 01:32:17,246
A10 Fusion is a 64-bit four-core

2779
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:19,416
processor with over 3.3 billion

2780
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:20,116
transistors.

2781
01:32:20,116 --> 01:32:22,246
It is a rocket ship.

2782
01:32:22,956 --> 01:32:25,446
First, it has two cores that are

2783
01:32:25,446 --> 01:32:26,976
high-performance cores.

2784
01:32:27,226 --> 01:32:28,946
These high-performance cores run

2785
01:32:28,946 --> 01:32:32,116
a full 40% faster than the A9

2786
01:32:32,116 --> 01:32:33,976
chip in the iPhone 6s and 6s

2787
01:32:34,046 --> 01:32:34,446
Plus.

2788
01:32:34,976 --> 01:32:36,126
And if you are coming from an

2789
01:32:36,126 --> 01:32:37,896
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, it's twice

2790
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,776
as fast than the A8.

2791
01:32:40,776 --> 01:32:41,916
Here is what the team has been

2792
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:42,766
doing over the years.

2793
01:32:43,386 --> 01:32:45,646
The A10 Fusion is now 120 times

2794
01:32:45,786 --> 01:32:47,356
faster than the original iPhone.

2795
01:32:47,616 --> 01:32:48,586
And look at the last three

2796
01:32:48,586 --> 01:32:50,556
years, from the 5s to the 6, the

2797
01:32:50,556 --> 01:32:53,056
6 to the 6s, to now the 7, the

2798
01:32:53,096 --> 01:32:54,656
jumps in performance are just

2799
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,426
staggering.

2800
01:32:56,346 --> 01:32:57,596
I said there are four cores.

2801
01:32:57,986 --> 01:32:59,436
The other two are what we call

2802
01:32:59,436 --> 01:33:00,816
high-efficiency cores.

2803
01:32:59,436 --> 01:33:00,816
high-efficiency cores.

2804
01:33:01,066 --> 01:33:02,786
They run at one-fifth the power

2805
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,206
of the high-performance core.

2806
01:33:04,486 --> 01:33:05,576
So when you're doing something

2807
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,256
that isn't performance limited

2808
01:33:07,256 --> 01:33:08,866
by the CPU, like checking your

2809
01:33:08,866 --> 01:33:10,186
email, that can run on the

2810
01:33:10,186 --> 01:33:11,586
high-efficiency core and get

2811
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,516

2812
01:33:13,586 --> 01:33:15,236
So how do we decide what runs on

2813
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:15,936
which core?
